In the U.S., the market for foot orthoses is segmented primarily by application, catering to various medical conditions and athletic needs.

Medical orthotic insoles are customized to address the unique biomechanical needs of patients and are often recommended by podiatrists and orthopedic specialists.

The demand for comfort orthoses is bolstered by consumers' growing awareness of the importance of foot health and wellness.

In addition to these primary segments, there is a niche market for pediatric orthoses designed specifically for children with developmental or congenital foot conditions.
